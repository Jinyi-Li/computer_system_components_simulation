## Simulated Computer System Components

The project was inspired by 15-513 Introduction to Computer Systems offered by Randy Bryant and Phil Gibbons, Carnegie Mellon University. It was developed in C to understand the foundations of computer systems.

- Simulated Linux malloc, calloc, realloc and free functions to dynamically manage memory on heap.
- Realized a thread-safe web proxy server with LRU cache, socket programming and POSIX Threads.
- Developed a tiny shell to support commands and executables, I/O redirection, and signal handling.
- Implemented a hardware cache simulator with LRU policy to handle Load and Store requests.
